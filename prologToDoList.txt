(Fixed) -hasCompoundName, atom_concat/3 instantiation error in cases 77 to 79.
(Fixed)  -hasParent2/2 is unable to take in variables.
-isa/2 can't take in a variable in either slot because it will return common names in the list(which should not happen, only tax names).
(Fixed) -issue with countSpecies, always returns a 0 in the list. Ie: countSpecies(pelecaniformes,X),
    should return 18, but instead it returns [18,0].
-Tests 169-171, rangesTo does not return the expected list.
-food/2, if A is a variable, the return should only be the compound names, no order/family/genus
^ same with habitat, nesting, behaviour, conservation.
